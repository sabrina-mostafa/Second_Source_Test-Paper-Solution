### == (Loose Equality):
The == operator checks whether two values are equal, but it ignores the data type. Before comparing, it converts the data types to be the same. This process is called type coercion.
- Example: 
  - "5" == 5 is true

### === (Strict Equality):
The === operator checks whether both the value and the data type are the same. It does not perform any type conversion. If the data types are different, the comparison will immediately return false.
- Example:
  - "5" === 5 is false
