### Closures 
- A closure is a function that allows to access variables from its outer function even after that outer function has completed execution.


### Example:

```js

function outerFunction() {
  let count = 0; 

  function innerFunction() {
    count++;  
    console.log("Count:", count);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}


const counter = outerFunction();
counter();  
counter(); 
counter(); 

```
