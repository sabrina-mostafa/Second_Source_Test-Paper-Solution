## Event Loop:
- The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations and ensures that code is executed in the correct order. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time in a single call stack. However, it can handle asynchronous operations like API calls, timers, or DOM events without blocking the main thread. The event loop is what makes this possible by managing the execution of synchronous and asynchronous code.

### Example:

```js

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");

```

### Explanation:
1. "Start" is logged immediately because it is synchronous.
2. setTimeout() is asynchronous, so it is sent to the Web API and the callback is set to execute after 2 seconds.
3. "End" is logged immediately after "Start" because the setTimeout() callback is not executed yet.
4. After 2 seconds, the "Inside setTimeout" callback is moved to the Task Queue.
5. The event loop checks if the call stack is empty and then moves the callback to the call stack, where it is executed.
