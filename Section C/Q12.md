### Benefits of useEffect over class lifecycle methods:

1. Single API: useEffect handles mount, update, and unmount in one place, unlike multiple class methods.

2. Cleaner code: You write related side-effect logic together, making it easier to read and maintain.

3. utomatic dependency tracking: useEffect runs only when its dependencies change, avoiding manual checks.

4. Simpler cleanup: Cleanup happens inside the effect by returning a function, not a separate method.

5. No this issues: Functional components donâ€™t need to worry about binding this.

Basically, useEffect makes managing side effects simpler and more intuitive than class lifecycle methods.
