### Difference:
- Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. On the other hand, State is used to manage data within a component itself. It is local and private to that component.


### Example Using Both Props and State:

```jsx (App.jsx)

import React from "react";
import Counter from "./Counter";

function App() {
  const initialCount = 5;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter App</h1>
      <Counter initialCount={initialCount} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```


```jsx (Counter.jsx)

import { useState } from "react";

const Counter = (props) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(props.initialCount);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Initial Count: {props.initialCount}</p>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;

```


### Explanation:
1. The initialCount prop is passed from App to Counter.
2. The count state is initialized with the initialCount prop value.
3. The state can be updated locally, but the prop remains read-only.
