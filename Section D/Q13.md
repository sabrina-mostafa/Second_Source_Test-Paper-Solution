## To-Do App UI Design:


### Layout:

1. Header: Centered app title for clear context.

2. Input: Top horizontal row with a wide text box and an “Add” button for quick task entry.

3. Task List: Vertical list with each task in a subtle card, showing a checkbox (left) and delete icon (right). Completed tasks have line-through and faded color.

4. Footer: Shows remaining tasks count and filters (All, Active, Completed).



### Colors:

- Soft off-white background for calmness.
- Teal primary color for buttons and highlights to attract attention gently.
- Dark gray text for readability; lighter gray and line-through for completed tasks.



### UX Decisions:

1. Input on top supports natural flow — add tasks first.

2. Immediate visual feedback on task completion (style change).

3. Clear but unobtrusive delete option to avoid mistakes.

4. Responsive design: stacks input/button on mobile for easy use.

5. Friendly empty state message to engage users.

6. Large clickable areas and good contrast for accessibility.
