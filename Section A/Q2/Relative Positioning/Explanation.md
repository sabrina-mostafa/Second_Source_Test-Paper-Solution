### Relative Positioning:
- Relative positioning moves the element relative to its original position.
- It still occupies its original space in the document flow.

### My code's Explanation:
- The .relative box is moved 20px down and 30px to the right from its original position.
- It still takes up its original space, meaning other elements are not affected.
