### Fixed Positioning:
- Fixed positioning removes the element from the flow and positions it relative to the viewport (browser window).
- It stays fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

### My code's Explanation:
- The .fixed box will remain 20px down and 30px to the right of the viewport, regardless of scrolling.
