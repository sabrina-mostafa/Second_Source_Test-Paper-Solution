### Absolute positioning:
- Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
- If no positioned ancestor is found, it positions relative to the viewport.

### My code's Explanation:
- The .absolute box is positioned 20px down and 30px to the right relative to the .container.
- It is removed from the normal flow, so other elements will ignore its space.
